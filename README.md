# Agential AI System - Blogger

A basic implementation of an agential system using only OpenAI's Structured Outputs and Python. The basic design is a hierarchical content development team with a Manager, a Researcher, and a Writer, each with their own specific tasks/capabilities. The goal is for the team to work together to develop a well constructed blog post without user input.
